//! Makes Warp-provided skills available to third-party harnesses (Claude Code,
//! Codex) by symlinking them into a skill root each harness already searches
//! on its own.
//!
//! Oz reads `WARP_SKILL_DIRS` directly (see
//! `crate::ai::agent_sdk::driver::AgentDriver::load_skills_dirs`). Third-party
//! harnesses discover skills from their own skill roots instead, so this
//! module reads the same `WARP_SKILL_DIRS` directories and symlinks each
//! skill folder into the harness's skill root, under the skill's own name.
//! The published name must match the real skill name (rather than some
//! namespaced alias) because an agent prompt, or another skill, may
//! reference a skill by that name. Skill frontmatter is never rewritten.
//! The feature-gated Factory MCP bootstrap is appended after these configured
//! sources, so a configured `factory-mcp` skill retains precedence.
//!
//! A publish target already counts as ours only when it is a symlink whose
//! canonical destination is this exact source directory — publishing is then
//! a no-op. A publish target's working directory is not guaranteed to be
//! fresh: a dormant harness session can wake for a follow-up and re-publish
//! into the same working directory it used before, so "is a symlink" alone
//! does not imply "is ours" (a foreign symlink can exist too, and repeated
//! runs need a real identity check, not an assumption). Anything else at the
//! target — a real file or directory, or a symlink pointing elsewhere or
//! nowhere — is a genuine conflict, resolved according to whether this run is
//! sandboxed (see `warp_isolation_platform::detect`):
//! - In a sandbox, we own the whole filesystem, so the published skill wins:
//!   the conflicting entry is renamed aside with a `.backup` suffix rather
//!   than deleted, so nothing is lost.
//! - Outside a sandbox (for example the self-hosted direct backend, which
//!   runs on a host we do not own) we never modify an entry that predates
//!   us. The skill is instead published under a `warp-<name>` alias (subject
//!   to the same ownership check), unless that alias also conflicts, in
//!   which case the skill is not published at all.
//!
//! Every conflict is logged (see `logging-and-error-reporting`) with enough
//! detail to debug later — there is no user-facing surface for this today,
//! so the log is for us, not the user.
//!
//! A symlink — never a copy — keeps a skill's relative paths (for example a
//! helper script the skill invokes) pointing at the real, versioned skill
//! tree.
