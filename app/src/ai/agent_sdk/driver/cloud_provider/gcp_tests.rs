///
/// We run a shell that writes a `started` marker, sleeps well past the timeout,
/// then writes a `done` marker. With `kill_on_drop(true)` (set by
/// `run_best_effort_with_timeout`) the shell is killed when the timeout drops
/// the wait future, so `done` is never written. Without the kill — the old
/// behavior, where `with_timeout` only stopped waiting on `output()` while the
/// spawned process kept running — the shell survives, wakes up after the sleep,
/// and writes `done`, which this test detects.
