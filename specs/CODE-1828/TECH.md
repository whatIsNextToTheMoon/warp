# Token / cost transparency in the TUI — TECH

Parent: [CODE-1828](https://linear.app/warpdotdev/issue/CODE-1828/token-cost-transparency). Sub-issues: [CODE-1831](https://linear.app/warpdotdev/issue/CODE-1831/tui-footer-token-usage-entry-with-click-to-toggle-cost) (footer entry) and [CODE-1832](https://linear.app/warpdotdev/issue/CODE-1832/tui-token-usage-next-to-the-loading-indicator-end-of-response-summary) (loading indicator + end-of-response summary row, blocked on PR [#13442](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/pull/13442)).

## Context

Per the [Figma mocks](https://www.figma.com/design/yg5nbPZuGoAszHS3Rhvehu/TUI?node-id=323-17499&t=ZINACTiPr1Rk74Dn-0) (frames `323:17499` tokens, `323:17553` hover, `323:17607` cost):

- The footer's right side shows a token entry between the branch and diff stats: `… ↬ main • 4 tok • +31 -12`. Clicking it toggles tokens ⇄ dollar cost (`$0.03`); no third state exists in the mocks.
- A completed agent response ends with a dim (`bright.black`) summary row: `∷ 1s • 4 tokens`. While streaming, the token count accompanies the `⋮ Warping (Ns)` indicator added by PR #13442 (unmerged; also adds the TUI animation machinery).

State before the proposed changes (historical):

- `crates/warp_tui/src/terminal_session_view.rs:317-364` — `render_footer` shows only the ctrl-c hint (left) and model name + cwd (right). No mouse handling, no tokens/cost.
- `crates/warp_tui/src/agent_block.rs`, `agent_block_sections.rs` — agent block sections are Input / PlainText / ToolCall / Thinking only; no per-exchange usage or duration row.
- No token-count or dollar formatting helper exists anywhere in the TUI or app crate (`format_credits` in `app/src/ai/blocklist/view_util.rs:145` formats credits, not tokens/dollars).

Data plumbing that already exists app-side (unused by the TUI):

- `app/src/ai/agent/conversation.rs` — `update_cost_and_usage_for_request` (line 1960) accumulates per-model `TokenUsage { total_input, output, input_cache_read, input_cache_write, cost_in_cents }` into `total_token_usage_by_model`; accessors `total_token_usage()` / `total_request_cost()` (lines 3489-3496) are `#[allow(dead_code)]` today. Dollar cost comes from `cost_in_cents` (`RequestCost` is credits, not dollars).
- `BlocklistAIHistoryEvent::ConversationUsageMetadataUpdated { conversation_id }` (`app/src/ai/blocklist/history_model.rs:1866`) fires on every usage update; the GUI usage footer subscribes to exactly this (`ConversationUsageView::new_footer_with_rollup`, `app/src/ai/blocklist/usage/conversation_usage_view.rs:156`).
- Per-exchange precedent for stream-derived metadata: `set_exchange_time_to_first_token` (`history_model.rs:1935`).
- The TUI consumes app types only through `app/src/tui_export.rs`.

## Proposed changes

### 1. App-side: conversation usage totals + exports (`app/`)

- New `ConversationUsageTotals { credits_spent: f32, cost_in_cents: f32 }` plus `AIConversation::usage_totals()`: credits come from the server's cumulative usage metadata (`inference_credits_spent() + platform_credits_spent()` — the exact number the GUI usage footer shows as "Credits spent (total)" and the details panel shows as "Credits used"), and provider dollar cost is summed across `total_token_usage_by_model` rows. Both fields are `f32`, mirroring their upstream sources (the usage metadata and the `TokenUsage.cost_in_cents` proto float); cents stay fractional — per-request provider costs are routinely sub-cent, so an integer type would truncate. A raw token count was rejected twice during review: summing per-request `total_input` re-counts the (mostly cached) context every request (`100k tok` next to `$0.05`), and even excluding cache reads the first request's ~35k system-prompt/context tokens dominate — no token semantic both matches the mock's scale and stays consistent across providers, so the entry shows the GUI's credits number instead.
- `format_credits` (the GUI's formatter in `app/src/ai/blocklist/view_util.rs`) is exported through `tui_export.rs` so the TUI renders credits identically to the GUI.
- `update_conversation_cost_and_usage_for_request` now also emits `ConversationUsageMetadataUpdated` for token-only updates (previously only for request-cost/metadata updates).
- Export `ConversationUsageTotals` through `tui_export.rs` — `BlocklistAIHistoryEvent` is already exported.
- No per-exchange capture is needed: the summary row consumes the existing block-level accessors (`credits_spent_for_last_block()`, `wall_to_wall_response_time_since_last_query()` — the same sources as the GUI footer's "Credits spent (last response)" and `TimingInfo`).

### 2. Shared TUI component (`crates/warp_tui/src/usage.rs`, new)

The reusable piece both sub-issues consume:

- Credits render via the GUI's `format_credits` (`2.5 credits`); `format_cost(cost_in_cents)` → `$0.03` (two decimals).
- `UsageToggle` — the hover/click wrapper around the footer entry (`TuiHoverable` from `crates/warpui_core/src/elements/tui/`), owned by `TuiTerminalSessionView`. The credits⇄cost display mode itself is the file-backed, TUI-only `agents.usage_display_mode` setting (`TuiUsageDisplayMode` in `AISettings`, `surface: Tui`, never cloud-synced — the `TuiAgentModel` pattern), so the choice persists across TUI sessions and hot-reloads with the settings file. The `MouseStateHandle` must be owned by the view, not created inline during render.
- **Deliberate mock deviation**: the Figma footer entry reads `4 tok`, but no token semantic survives contact with reality (see section 1), so the entry shows GUI-consistent credits instead — flagged for design review on CODE-1831.
- Styles come from `TuiUiBuilder` (`dim_text_style`/`muted_text_style`), using contrast-adaptive theme foreground recipes so the footer remains legible on light and custom backgrounds.
- Hover affordance brightens from `muted_text_style` to `primary_text_style`. A pointing-hand mouse pointer (the mock's hover cursor) is **explicitly out of scope for this PR** and tracked as a fast follow in [CODE-1837](https://linear.app/warpdotdev/issue/CODE-1837/tui-pointing-hand-cursor-on-hover-over-the-footer-usage-entry-osc-22): it needs OSC 22 pointer-shape plumbing in the TUI core (a working, PTY-verified implementation is preserved in this branch's history at commit `348484d57`) plus host-terminal support that Warp's own terminal lacks today (in progress on `ian/warp-terminal-osc22-pointer-shape`).

### 3. Footer entry (CODE-1831, `terminal_session_view.rs`)

- In `new`: subscribe to `BlocklistAIHistoryModel`; on `ConversationUsageMetadataUpdated` for this surface's selected conversation (`conversation_selection.selected_conversation_id`), `ctx.notify()`. Add the new event arm explicitly — no wildcard matches (repo convention).
- In `render_footer`: after the cwd and watcher-backed branch, render `• ` + the toggle component using the selected conversation's totals, followed by colored diff stats; hide the usage entry until the first usage event (mock shows it only with data). A click dispatches a typed action (`ToggleUsageDisplay`) whose handler flips the persisted display-mode setting — the element pass only holds an immutable `AppContext`, so settings writes go through the view's action handler.

### 4. Last-response summary in the indicator slot (CODE-1832, stacked PR)

- Mock re-read (frames `323:17216` streaming, `323:17499` completed): usage is **hidden while streaming** (the `4 tok • +14 -54` element is `opacity: 0` next to the live `⋮ Warping (1s)` row) and appears only in the completed state as `∷ 1s • …` — the indicator's resting form in the same slot. So the Warping row ships unchanged, and on completion the slot swaps to a static summary row.
- `render_response_summary(duration, block_credits, app)` in `warping_indicator.rs` (the row is the indicator family's resting form): `∷ {N}s • {credits}` in `muted_text_style` (mock `#8e8e8e`), credits via the GUI's `format_credits`, the credits segment omitted until any are reported (> 0).
- Wired in `TuiTerminalSessionView::render`: in-progress → Warping row (unchanged); otherwise, when `wall_to_wall_response_time_since_last_query()` is available (requires a finished exchange, so new conversations stay clean), render the summary with `credits_spent_for_last_block()`. Repaints reuse CODE-1831's `ConversationUsageMetadataUpdated` subscription plus the status-change repaint that already removes the Warping row.
- The mock's per-exchange transcript rows for *historical* blocks would need per-block stamping app-side; deferred as a follow-up if product wants history parity (data exists only for the last block today).

## Testing and validation

- Unit tests in sibling `_tests.rs` files per repo convention: `usage_tests.rs` (cost formatting edge cases, credits text parity with the GUI's `format_credits`, credits⇄cost toggle, shared clone state) and `warping_indicator_tests.rs` (summary row renders `∷ 5s • 2.5 credits` with no repaint scheduling; credits segment omitted for `None`/zero).
- App-side tests in `conversation_tests.rs`: `usage_totals` reads the cumulative server credits snapshot (replace, not sum) and accumulates provider cost across requests.
- Commands: `cargo nextest run -p warp_tui`, `cargo nextest run -p warp` (touched test files), `cargo clippy -p warp_tui --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `./script/format` — all must pass before each PR (presubmit requirement).
- Manual: `./script/run-tui`; send a prompt; verify the footer credits entry appears and updates, click toggles `2.5 credits` ⇄ `$0.03` and back, summary row appears after completion; compare against Figma frames `323:17499`/`323:17607` (noting the deliberate tok→credits deviation).

## Parallelization

Parallel child agents are not proposed for implementation: both surfaces share the usage plumbing and the touched files overlap heavily (`terminal_session_view.rs`, `tui_export.rs`), so sequential, stacked delivery is cleaner (child agents are used for verification instead — PTY byte-level checks and computer-use recordings):

1. PR 1: app-side conversation totals + exports + `usage.rs` + footer entry (CODE-1831), branch `ian/code-1831-tui-footer-token-usage-entry-with-click-to-toggle-cost`.
2. PR 2 (#13442 has merged): last-response summary row in the indicator slot (CODE-1832), branch `ian/code-1832-tui-credits-next-to-the-loading-indicator`, stacked on PR 1 with graphite.

## Risks and mitigations

- The summary row covers only the last response block (block-level data is all that exists); historical per-block rows in the transcript are a follow-up if product wants history parity. Restored conversations show the row once their accessors resolve from restored exchanges/metadata, and render nothing otherwise.
- Footer click is the TUI's first mouse-interactive footer element; keep the hit target to the entry's cells only so text selection elsewhere in the footer is unaffected.
